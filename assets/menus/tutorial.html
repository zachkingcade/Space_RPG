        Welcome Space Rangers! This is your standard issue quick start guide. If you look
        in your standard issue POC Ship's glove compartment you'll find a basic ball shot
        revolver. This will be your standard issue weapon until you can prove yourself 
        worthy of additional weaponry. Your mission as a new recruit is to go out and
        help lower level planets in any way they may need you to (TL-6 and below planets).
        YOU MUST avoid TL-7 and above planets at all costs. If you find yourself stuck or
        otherwise stranded on a TL-7 or above planet you must call for backup using your
        ship's radio IMMEDIATELY.
        Now with that out of the way, you were provided a gun for a reason. On TL-3 and
        above planets you may run into wildlife and perhaps even people that would mean
        do you harm. You have been provided a set of HUD Glasses(TM) That will attempt
        to provide information about both enemies and surroundings. Below is a picture
        example of a set of HUD Glasses(TM) in action.

        As you can see the system attempts to Identify the creatures name, health/condition
        and how many turns until that creature attacks you. All of this is vital information
        in combat. Speaking of combat you will need to fight back and defend yourself, you
        can use this using the revolver and black device in the glove box called a Charge
        Portal. The Charge Portal will generate a constant stream of Shot Orbs as seen in
        an illustration below. If you look in your glove box you'll also notice AP charges
        that can be used to destroy large boulders of other objects blocking your path. These
        also take Shot Orbs but a large amount of them to charge the device. (If you get a large
        combo). Simply click one of the orbs to attack, try to get a large group of similarly
        colored orbs for a more powerful attack.
